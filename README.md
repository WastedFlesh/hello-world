# hello-world
the thing for the work thing kk
idek what is happening im just following the guide

im guessing this is like the thing we did as a start to programming wy back when right, just on this github thing
kk

its funny that the guide thinks their funny honestly but humor is subjective right?
even of this one is objectively bad?
idk if u noticed but im not in a great mood rn
